                        <br/>
                        <p>The standard of play is equivalent to a good high school program. A few of the inmate team have played at a higher level and everyone is in good shape so the games are very competitive.</p>

                        <br/>
                        <p>The current roster is a mix of rec league players, college players from the D1, D2 and D3 levels as well as former professionals. So long as you played at the high school level (or there about) and are enthused about soccer, youâ€™ll fit in just fine.</p>

                        <br/>
                        <p>The SQ soccer season goes from March until November.</p>

                        <p class = "text-2xl"><strong><u>When do games get played?</u></strong></p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Most games take place on a Saturday afternoon. Once the SFSFL leagues end in the fall, the San Francisco branch of the Outsiders play a couple of Sunday games as well.</p>

                        <p class = "text-2xl"><strong><u>What is the commitment required for the Outsiders?</u></strong></p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Some players play every fortnight, some play once or twice a year. So long as you reply to availability requests in a timely fashion and make those games, we find a way to get everyone involved.</p>

                        <p class = "text-2xl"><strong><u>Can women play for the Outsiders?</u></strong></p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>No. Whilst we have a number of female players who help coach and manage the Outsider teams, we are not able to field women in the games themselves.</p>
